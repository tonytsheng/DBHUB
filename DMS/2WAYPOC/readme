Simple Proof of Concept for 2 Way Replication

- Heartbeat table, Unique index, Sequence
- Driver script to load data based on either SITEA or SITEB as an input parameter
- appmap - mapping file for database connection info based on site
- v2 - loaded appmap data into a dynamodb table - see ins.ddb.appmap.py

DMS config is not included in this directory
- Migration tasks must include loopback prevention
- Sequences are not replicated and therefore must be seeded per site
- No conflict resolution across sites
