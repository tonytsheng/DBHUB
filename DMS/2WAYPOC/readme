Simple Proof of Concept for 2 Way Replication

2022-06-17
- Read from DynamoDB table based on input parameter
- Get engine
- Insert and Query latest based on which engine, inserting respective SITE
- Note that DMS migration tasks are not in this repo
- ins.dyn.appmap.py - loads appmap DDB table
- scan.dyn.appmap.cli - query appmap DDB table



- Heartbeat table, Unique index, Sequence
- Driver script to load data based on either SITEA or SITEB as an input parameter
- appmap - mapping file for database connection info based on site
- v2 - loaded appmap data into a dynamodb table - see ins.ddb.appmap.py

DMS config is not included in this directory
- Migration tasks must include loopback prevention
- Sequences are not replicated and therefore must be seeded per site
- No conflict resolution across sites
