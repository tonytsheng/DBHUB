Simple Proof of Concept for 2 Way Replication

A simple python database client that reads from a DynamoDB table
to determine which database engine and related endpoint information to connect to 
Used initially for a DMS 2WAY POC

====
Set up scripts

1.cr8.ddb.appmap.py - create a DynamoDB table to store appmap information
2.ins.dyn.appmap.py - load a DynamoDB table called appmap with application id and database endpoint information
3.cr8.ora.heart.sql - create an example heartbeat table in oracle
3.cr8.pg.heart.sql - create an example heartbeat table in postgresql

====
To run
python3 appinsert.v3.py SITEA|SITEB

- Read from DynamoDB table based on input parameter
- Get engine
- Insert and Query latest based on which engine, inserting respective SITE
- Note that DMS migration tasks are not in this repo
- ins.dyn.appmap.py - loads appmap DDB table
- scan.dyn.appmap.cli - query appmap DDB table



- Heartbeat table, Unique index, Sequence
- Driver script to load data based on either SITEA or SITEB as an input parameter
- appmap - mapping file for database connection info based on site
- v2 - loaded appmap data into a dynamodb table - see ins.ddb.appmap.py

DMS config is not included in this directory
- Migration tasks must include loopback prevention
- Sequences are not replicated and therefore must be seeded per site
- No conflict resolution across sites
