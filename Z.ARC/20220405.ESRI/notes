scenario 1
tables with geometry column
primary key added
geo columns indexed
dms won't replicate all of the data for full load
we can insert 10 rows at a time for esrifeatureclass and it does not error out
we cannot insert via cursor the whole 545 rows - errors for row 61

scenario 2
with no pk, the shape columns will be skipped - since blob columns
