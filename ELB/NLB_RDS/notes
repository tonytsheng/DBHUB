add oracle ip to target group
10.1.2.187:1521
add to pending target
register target
wait for it to become healthy
maybe open a port or something - won't go green

elb can only span resource in the same vpc
  but can do it if you peer vpcs


EC2 console
Target Groups under Load Balancing

Create Target Group
  Click IP addreses
  Target Group Name 
  Protocol - TCP and Database Port Number
  Click the appropriate VPC in the drop down
  Dont worry about health checks 
  Next
  Register Targets
    VPC in drop down
    Add ip for your database - may need to do an nslookup on the endpoint
    Make sure port is right
    Create target group

Click Load Balancers - Create
  Create Network Load Balancer
  Give it a load balancer name
  Internal
  IPv4
  Click the appropriate VPC in the drop down
  Listener - TCP and database port and select a target group
  Click Creae

Go to VPC Security Groups
You will need to open the database port for the subnet(s) that your database is running in.
So add an inbound rule for port 5432, subnet 10.0.2.0/24 for example.

Wait for load balancer to become available

Then call your database client cli program with the NLB endpoint instead of the database endpoint.
