customer got a expdp dump file
needed to load it didn't have the logs so didn't know schema etc
cx also not deep with oracle exp/imp utilities

able to extract ddl using impdp sql option to pull ddl

found schema name

used that in the impdp schema option to load

table already existed from previous run

tried to drop table - resource wait

saw lots of imp jobs in dba_datapump_jobs
tried to kill with attach job
syntax error

able to drop meta table instead for all of them
sys_import_schema_04 for example

drop table - table didn't exist
ran imp - 84G will prob run for a while
