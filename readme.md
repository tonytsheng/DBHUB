## Thanks
Thanks for stopping by. This repo represents almost 30 years of database engineering experience and has been my go to place to store things out of my head for the past 2 years or so. So, it is my best work lol.

## First job
I started in technology when I finished grad school in March of 1993. I worked for about a year for RWD Technologies, mostly building an internal tool.

## Bell Atlantic/Verizon
I then spent about 13 years at Bell Atlantic/Verizon in the DBA seat and then managing a DBA team. That was a pretty amazing experience - amazing team members and lots of performance tuning and database replication architectures. Best lesson learned there: When it comes to database performance, pay me now or pay me later. At some point, you will have to tune your application. Either do it early or do it after your users complain about it. Obviously, the former is preferrable.

## SAIC/Leidos
I then spent 10 years with SAIC/Leidos working with Federal government customers. Most of this was standard DBA work as well as performance and tuning, enterprise architecture and database replication. I spent a lot of time with Oracle Streams.

## Oracle
I spent almost 4 years working for Oracle doing the same kind of database things for Federal government customers. Oracle Golden Gate was in the mix during this time.

## AWS
I'm currently a Database Specialist Solutions Architect at AWS and have been here since Oct 2020. I deal with most of our purpose built databases as well as some of our Analytics services and spend a good amount of time with the Database Migration Service as well.

This repo is mostly organized around AWS services/offerings. The SCRIPTLIB is the stuff that I use most every day.
I hope something in here helps you with your database solutions.
