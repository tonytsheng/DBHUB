Thanks for stopping by. This repo represents almost 30 years of database engineering experience and has been my go to place to store things out of my head for the past 2 years or so. So, it is my best work lol.
I started in technology when I finished grad school in March of 1993. I worked for about a year for RWD Technologies, mostly building an internal tool. I then spent about 13 years at Bell Atlantic/Verizon in the DBA seat and then managing a DBA team. That was a pretty amazing experience - amazing team members and lots of performance tuning and database replication architectures. I then spent 10 years with SAIC/Leidos and another almost 4 years working for Oracle, and both of those were doing the same kind of database things for Federal government customers. I'm currently a Database Specialist Solutions Architect at AWS and have been here since Oct 2020.
This repo is mostly organized around AWS services/offerings. My focus is our purpose built databases so those form the bulk of material here. I've also been digging into our Analytics offerings too. The SCRIPTLIB is the stuff that I use most every day.
I hope something in here helps you with your database solutions.
