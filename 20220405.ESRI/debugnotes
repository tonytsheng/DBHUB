make sure pk on primary
if there is not, it will not create blob columns on target
have dms recreate table
look for "]E:" or "]W:" in the logs
set parameter log_min_duration_statement - 0 on rds postgresql in parameter group
make task do single table
can give aswim dump file
commit after 50K rows in this case - tx size is dependent
ignore last column - special character
dms task - transformation rule - remove column for target
removed column lower transform rule

dropped municipality column from both source and target tables - this is not the problem
