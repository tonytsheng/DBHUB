generate index sql file from a list of tables

put your tables into the tlist file

run the ./gen_idx script

take the output and run it in psql

notes
+ this is postgresql syntax
+ you will need to edit the schema name, column name and index name if applicable
+ index name looks like idx_$table_name_ts right now
+ if the table name is really long, the generated index name might be too long
